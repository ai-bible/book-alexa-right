---

## Context

**Character States**:
- **Alexa**: Urgent call to Golden Terrace, elite client (Havenford) in critical temporal state. Professional mode, masking any reaction to Sebastian's contempt. Accustomed to this treatment. Timer visible on wrist. Focused on job.
- **Sebastian**: Managing crisis (dying chronomagnat), summoned short-timer service worker. Views her as necessary evil - skilled but inferior caste. Formal professionalism masking disdain. Assessing if she's competent enough for this client.

**Relationship Dynamic**: Service hierarchy. He's gatekeeper to elite world, she's skilled labor. He holds positional power, she holds expertise. He treats her as function, not person.

**Story Position**: Urgent call that leads to cat rescue and beginning of investigation. First meeting. Sebastian doesn't know yet that he'll become witness to her "crime."

   - **Tone**: Cold professional courtesy

2. **Development**: Brief while escorting to client

## Subtext

**Surface Conversation**: Manager briefing specialist on urgent case

**Real Meaning**:
- Sebastian: "You're skilled labor I need right now, but don't mistake necessity for respect"
- Alexa: "I know what you think of me. I'm here to do the job."
- Both: "Our roles are clear. Stay in your lane."

**Unsaid Elements**:
- Sebastian's glance at her temporal bracelet = class assessment
- Pause before "Miss Rayt" = calculated distance
- His formal language = barrier between castes
- Alexa's brevity = refusing to engage with his contempt
- His physical distance = contamination fear?
- She's been through this a thousand times
- He's performed this role (managing inferiors) for decades

**Power Dynamic**:
- Sebastian controls access, space, information
- Alexa holds expertise he needs
- He can demean her socially while depending on her professionally
- She can't challenge his treatment without risking job
- Both locked in system-defined roles

## Information Exchange

### Sebastian Learns
- Alexa is competent (asks right questions)
- She's professional despite his treatment (useful)
- Confirms she's short-timer (bracelet visible)

### Alexa Learns
- Client: Havenford, critical temporal state
- Sebastian is cold but efficient
- This will be high-stakes case

### What Remains Hidden
- Sebastian's deeper contempt (hidden under professionalism)
- Alexa's habituated pain (masked by professionalism)
- That Sebastian will become witness to her later actions
- The cat's existence (not yet discovered)

### Information Consistency Check
✅ First meeting between them
✅ Alexa summoned on urgent call (established in scene 2.1)
✅ Havenford dying (leads to her memory work and cat discovery)
✅ Sebastian manages Golden Terrace (18 years experience)
✅ Class hierarchy visible but not verbally addressed

## Emotional Arc

**Sebastian**:
- Begins: Cool professional assessment
- During: Maintained formal distance, efficient briefing
- Ends: Task complete, monitors from distance
- **No arc**: He's stable in his contempt/role

**Alexa**:
- Begins: Professional mode, masking reaction
- During: Focused on getting information needed
- Ends: Indignity noted and filed away, focus on work
- **No arc**: This is routine discrimination for her

**Relationship Impact**: Establishes baseline: he looks down on her, she's accustomed to this. Foundation for later encounters where dynamic shifts.

## Style Guidance

**Tone**: Cold, professional, formal, transactional

**Pacing**:
- Brisk - he's efficient
- No lingering - get her to the job
- Functional exchange

**Dialogue Techniques**:
- Formality as weapon (titles, complete sentences, no warmth)
- Brevity from Alexa (refuses to engage beyond professional minimum)
- Physical beats between lines show relationship
- What's NOT said (no small talk, no personal acknowledgment)

**Physical Choreography**:
- Setting: Landing platform → corridors → client suite door
- Sebastian: Perfect posture, measured gestures, maintains physical distance (2+ meters?), no casual touch (contrast to how he might greet peer)
- Alexa: Controlled, professional, bracelet visible on wrist, doesn't react to his coldness
- Key moment: His eyes on her bracelet (micro-expression of disdain), she notices but doesn't react
- Walking: He leads, she follows (hierarchy physical)
- At door: He opens, steps back (creates distance), gesture of "in you go" without warmth

**Author Style Reference**: Joe Abercrombie - class contempt shown through physical details (glance at bracelet, distance maintained, formal gestures), dialogue sparse, relationship shown not told

## Function in Arc

**Plot Function**:
- Delivers Alexa to Havenford case (where she finds cat)
- Establishes Sebastian as witness to her presence
- Sets up his later involvement in security investigation

**Character Function**:
- Shows Alexa's daily experience of discrimination
- Establishes Sebastian's class ideology and role
- Demonstrates how professional competence doesn't protect from caste contempt
- Shows Alexa's habituation (this doesn't shock her, it's normal)

**Theme Function**:
- Class/temporal hierarchy made physical
- Professional skill doesn't equal human dignity
- System treats people as functions
- Casual cruelty of normalized discrimination

**Arc Positioning**: Inciting incident for investigation. First link in chain that leads to exposure. Sebastian as witness established.

## Validation Notes

**Risks**:
- ⚠️ Sebastian could seem cartoonishly villainous if contempt too obvious
- ⚠️ Over-explaining class dynamics in prose would be heavy-handed
- ⚠️ Alexa might seem weak if reaction to treatment not carefully calibrated

**Opportunities**:
- ✅ SHOW class barrier through physical details, not dialogue
- ✅ Glance at bracelet = volumes without words
- ✅ Formal language = weaponized courtesy
- ✅ Alexa's non-reaction shows this is routine (more damning than shock)
- ✅ Establishes baseline for later scenes where his coldness cracks

**Key Success Factors**:
- Contempt subtle, professional - he's not overtly cruel, just coldly formal
- Contrast how he'd treat peer vs. how he treats her (implicit)
- Bracelet glance is KEY moment - micro-expression, she sees it, moves on
- Alexa's competence despite treatment
- Brief exchange - he's efficient, not engaging
- Reader should feel indignity without it being stated
- Sets up contrast for later scenes when he shows humanity
- Existing scene (2.1) modified minimally - add name, enhance subtext, brief exchange
