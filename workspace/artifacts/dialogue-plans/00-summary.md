Total planned dialogue volume: ~1200-1600 words across 6 exchanges

---

## David Carroll (3 dialogues, ~450-650 words total)

### 01-david-smalltalk.md (~150-200 words)
**Context**: Chapter 1, Scene 1.2 expansion - Office between clients
**Function**: Establish baseline normalcy, contrast full life vs. isolation, foreshadow disruption
**Emotional arc**: Friendliness (David) → polite deflection (Alexa) → baseline set
**Key decision**: Show Alexa's loneliness through David's unconscious display of normal life (family, parks, weekends)
**Speech patterns**: David - warm, chatty, family mentions; Alexa - brief professional responses, deflection

---

### 02-david-witness.md (~200-300 words)
**Context**: New scene after Chapter 2.3 - Late evening, office, David sees suspicious searches
**Function**: Create tension, position David as threat, accelerate timeline to exposure, paranoia spike
**Emotional arc**: Surprise → concern → suspicion (David); Startled → controlled lie → paranoia (Alexa)
**Key decision**: David's backward glance when leaving = visual trust breach
**Speech patterns**: David - cautious questions, warning about security monitoring; Alexa - improvised technical lies, deflection
**Subtext**: "I saw what you're doing" vs. "Please don't report this"

---

### 03-david-isolation.md (~100-150 words)
**Context**: New scene after Point of No Return - Corridor encounter post-exposure
**Function**: Symbolize burned bridges, show cost of choice, amplify isolation, final goodbye to normal life
**Emotional arc**: Guilt/dread (David) → numb exhaustion (Alexa) → both isolated
**Key decision**: BREVITY and SILENCE as primary tools - minimal dialogue, heavy pauses
**Speech patterns**: David - fragmented, apologetic, trailing off; Alexa - monosyllables or silence
**Subtext**: His apology seeks absolution she won't give; her silence more damning than anger
**Visual**: Her standing alone after he leaves = physical isolation

---

## Sebastian Grey (3 dialogues, ~750-950 words total)

### 04-sebastian-meeting.md (~50-100 words)
**Context**: Chapter 2, Scene 2.1 modification - Golden Terrace, urgent Havenford call
**Function**: Establish class barrier through cold professionalism, set up witness position
**Emotional arc**: Cold assessment (Sebastian) → masked professionalism (Alexa) → baseline hierarchy
**Key decision**: Glance at temporal bracelet = class contempt shown not told
**Speech patterns**: Sebastian - formal, cold, no contractions; Alexa - brief professional responses
**Subtext**: "You're necessary function, not person" vs. "I know what you think, here to do job"
**Physical**: Maintains distance, formal gestures, leads/she follows (hierarchy)

---

### 05-sebastian-security.md (~250-400 words)
**Context**: New scene after Chapter 2 - Video call/neural interface, security investigation
**Function**: Escalate paranoia, create time pressure, first crack in Sebastian's coldness
**Emotional arc**: Professional anxiety (Sebastian) → first hint of concern; Fear/calculation (Alexa)
**Key decision**: Sebastian's motivation kept AMBIGUOUS - warning or CYA unclear
**Speech patterns**: Sebastian - formal but strained, careful word choice, pauses; Alexa - guarded questions, minimal disclosure
**Subtext**: "I know you took something, they're coming" vs. "How much do you know? Can I trust this?"
**Physical**: Split setting (office/apartment), cat nearby but hidden (stakes visual)

---

### 06-sebastian-choice.md (~400-600 words)
**Context**: New scene after Point of No Return - Sebastian's office, desperate information request
**Function**: Climactic moral choice, crack class ideology, show cost of helping, define Sebastian's character
**Emotional arc**: Fear/panic → internal war → choice (Sebastian); Desperation → dignity → acceptance (Alexa)
**Key decision**: Genuine dilemma - helping OR refusing both have real costs and consequences
**Speech patterns**: Sebastian - formal breaking into fragments, voice hoarse/breaking; Alexa - direct, stripped of pretense, accepts refusal
**Subtext**: 52 years of complicity vs. one woman's humanity; dignity shifts power
**Physical**: His visible internal battle (trembling, can't meet eyes, breathing), her stillness (dignity in desperation)
**Outcome options**:
- Helps: "Level 45, East Tower, abandoned sector" - relief/terror/accomplice
- Refuses: Safety/crushing guilt/moral death

## Key Stylistic Decisions

### Speech Pattern Differentiation
**David Carroll**:
- Baseline: Warm, conversational, family-oriented
- Under stress: Cautious, warning tone, fragmented
- Post-exposure: Apologetic, incomplete sentences, pauses

**Sebastian Grey**:
- Baseline: Cold formality, perfect grammar, no contractions
- Under pressure: Strained formality, careful word choice, pauses
- Moral crisis: Formal structure breaking down, voice quality changes, fragments

**Alexa Rayt** (consistent across):
- Professional, controlled, economical
- Brief responses, deflection skilled
- Stress shown through brevity intensifying, not breaking

### Dialogue Techniques (Joe Abercrombie Style)
- Physical details carry emotion (glances, pauses, body language)
- Short exchanges, no exposition dumps
- Subtext heavier than text
- Silence and pauses as dialogue
- What's NOT said matters most
- Show relationship through physical choreography
- Minimal words, maximum impact

### Thematic Integration
**David arc** - Isolation theme:
- Normalcy → suspicion → abandonment
- Shows cost: professional identity, social connections, last ties to "normal"
- Function: barometer of normalcy crumbling

**Sebastian arc** - Class/complicity theme:
- Cold hierarchy → moral discomfort → defining choice
- Shows system forcing impossible choices
- Function: can individuals resist unjust system?

**Both arcs** serve Alexa's isolation:
- David = lost normalcy
- Sebastian = class barrier breached (too late to help fully)
- Neither can save her, both define her loss

## Function in Alexa's Arc

### Plot Integration
- David accelerates exposure (witness)
- Sebastian provides critical information (if helps) OR confirms isolation (if refuses)
- Both increase paranoia and time pressure
- Both show surveillance reach

### Character Development
- Alexa's effect on others (her humanity undeniable)
- Her choices cost her everything (bridges burned)
- Her dignity maintained despite desperation
- Professional mask cracking under pressure

### Thematic Resonance
- Temporal inequality (David's stability, Sebastian's complicity, Alexa's precarity)
- Surveillance state (colleagues as informants)
- System turning people against each other
- Individual conscience vs. systemic pressure
- Cost of truth vs. safety

## Production Notes

### For Prose Writers
- Don't over-explain subtext - trust reader
- Physical choreography critical - show through action
- Pauses and silences noted but don't over-direct
- Let moments breathe
- Resist urge to interpret for reader

### For Scene Integration
- David Scene 1: Expansion of existing 1.2 (~300-500 words added)
- David Scene 2: New standalone (~600-900 words total)
- David Scene 3: New standalone (~400-600 words total)
- Sebastian Scene 1: Modification of existing 2.1 (~100-200 words changed/added)
- Sebastian Scene 2: New standalone (~800-1100 words total)
- Sebastian Scene 3: New standalone (~1000-1400 words total)

### Validation Checkpoints
✅ Speech patterns distinct between characters
✅ Emotional arcs serve Alexa's isolation theme
✅ Information exchange tracked (no knowledge inconsistencies)
✅ Subtext designed, not just noted
✅ Physical choreography planned for key moments
✅ Ambiguity preserved where thematically important (Sebastian's motivations, David's exact betrayal)
✅ Joe Abercrombie style principles applied (brevity, physicality, subtext, moral complexity)
✅ Timeline consistency maintained across all scenes
✅ Each dialogue serves multiple functions (plot, character, theme)
