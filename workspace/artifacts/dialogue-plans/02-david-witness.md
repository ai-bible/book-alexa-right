# David Carroll - Witness (Suspicious Activity)

**Scene Location**: After Chapter 2, Scene 2.3 (New scene during Alexa's investigation)
**Participants**: Alexa Rayt (POV), David Carroll
**Estimated Length**: 200-300 words of dialogue
**Purpose**: Create tension, accelerate timer to exposure, show paranoia taking hold, position David as unwitting threat

---

## Context

**Character States**:
- **Alexa**: Late evening, alone in office, conducting unsanctioned database searches about "Babylon" project. Tense, paranoid, focused. Knows she's breaking rules. Startled when David enters. Needs to lie convincingly.
- **David**: Came back to office for forgotten documents/files, surprised to find Alexa working late. Initially curious, becomes concerned when he sees unusual search patterns on her screen. Caught between professional concern and personal discomfort.

**Relationship Dynamic**: Starting to fracture. David's innocent curiosity becomes threat. Alexa must perform normalcy while terrified.

**Story Position**: Mid-investigation. Alexa has found traces of "Babylon" but needs more data. This encounter accelerates timeline to exposure.

**Characteristic Phrases**:
- "Working late?" (casual opener)
- "I didn't see that project in our assignments..."
- References security protocols, proper channels
- Tries to maintain friendly tone but can't hide suspicion

**Emotional Expression**: Confused → concerned → wary
**This Scene State**: Transition from friendly colleague to potential informant. Doesn't want confrontation but can't ignore what he saw.

**Sentence Structure**: Starts short (startled), becomes more elaborate (building lie), returns to short (deflection)
**Characteristic Phrases**:
- Technical jargon to create plausibility
- Deflection to work legitimacy
- Casual dismissal to end conversation

**Emotional Expression**: Masked panic, performed casualness
**This Scene State**: Adrenaline spike, improvising cover story, calculating risk of his knowledge

**Example Phrasing**:
- "David. Didn't hear you come in" (startled)
- "Cross-referencing case patterns for quarterly review" (technical lie)
- "Nothing unusual, just deep dive research" (deflection)
- "I should finish this tonight" (dismissal)

## Dialogue Structure

### Key Points
1. **Opening**: David enters unexpectedly, Alexa startled
   - **Topic**: Why are you here so late?
   - **Tone**: Surprised on both sides, shifts to awkward

2. **Development**: David saw her screen, questions what she's working on
   - **Point A**: David asks about unusual searches/project nomenclature
   - **Point B**: Alexa improvises explanation (quarterly review, pattern analysis, helping another department)
   - **Turning Point**: David says he didn't see it in assignments, mentions security monitoring

3. **Closing**: Conversation ends with mutual discomfort
   - **Resolution**: Unresolved - David doesn't believe her, but doesn't push
   - **Emotional Landing**: David - troubled, will think about this; Alexa - paranoid, knows she's exposed

### Approximate Flow
```
[David enters workspace, sees Alexa at terminal]
David: Surprised greeting, "working late?"
Alexa: Startled, minimizes screen?, tries casual response
David: Casual question about project, mentions seeing screen
Alexa: Quick lie - work-related explanation
David: Gentle probing - "didn't see that in our assignments"
Alexa: Elaborates lie - quarterly review/cross-department
David: Warning tone - "security monitors unusual searches"
Alexa: Deflects, thanks him, tries to end conversation
David: Uncomfortable acceptance, exits
[Alexa alone, realizes she's blown]
```

## Subtext

**Surface Conversation**: Colleague checking on late-night work

**Real Meaning**:
- David: "I saw what you were searching. That's not normal work."
- Alexa: "Please don't report this. Please believe my lie."
- David: "I don't believe you, but I don't want to get involved."

**Unsaid Elements**:
- David knows she's lying - her explanation doesn't match what he saw
- Alexa knows he saw enough to report her
- Both aware conversation is performance
- David's mention of "security monitoring" is warning or threat (ambiguous)
- His warning could be kindness (giving her heads-up) or CYA (distancing himself)

**Power Dynamic**:
- Alexa tries to control through technical jargon and deflection
- David holds power through knowledge
- Conversation is negotiation: will he report her?
- Ends ambiguously - he leaves without committing either way

---

## Information Exchange

### David Learns
- Alexa is conducting unusual database searches late at night
- Search terms/project names not in official assignments
- She's lying about the reason (her explanation unconvincing)
- She's nervous (unusual for competent Alexa)

### Alexa Learns
- David saw her screen - enough to identify unusual activity
- He's aware of security monitoring protocols
- He's uncomfortable but not immediately hostile
- She can't trust him to stay quiet

### What Remains Hidden
- David doesn't know specifics: cat, Babylon, deleted memories
- Alexa doesn't know: will he report this?
- Neither knows: is this conversation already monitored?

### Information Consistency Check
✅ David knows office protocols (established in his character)
✅ Alexa knows she's breaking rules (post-cat theft, investigating)
✅ Neither has confronted security/violation directly before
✅ Timeline: After Scene 2.3 (memory dive), before full exposure

## Emotional Arc

**David**:
- Begins: Surprised, mildly curious
- During: Increasingly concerned, confused by her explanation
- Ends: Troubled, suspicious, uncertain what to do
- **Internal shift**: From friendly colleague to potential informant

**Alexa**:
- Begins: Startled, instant panic
- During: Controlled performance of normalcy, building lie
- Ends: Heightened paranoia, knows timeline accelerated
- **Internal shift**: From careful investigator to hunted

**Relationship Impact**: Trust broken. Even if David doesn't report immediately, the ease between them is gone. He saw behind her mask.

## Style Guidance

**Tone**: Tense, awkward, paranoid undercurrent beneath surface professionalism

**Pacing**:
- Fast opening (startled entrance)
- Slowed middle (careful verbal chess)
- Uncomfortable pauses (both calculating)
- Abrupt end (David exits, leaving tension)

**Dialogue Techniques**:
- Interrupted sentences (discomfort)
- Pauses/beats (both thinking)
- Over-explanation (Alexa building lie)
- Careful word choice (David not accusing directly)
- Subtext heavier than text

**Physical Choreography**:
- Alexa: Minimizes or shifts screen? Turns to face him? Casual posture (performed)
- David: Stands in doorway (not committing to enter fully), shifts weight, glances at screen again
- Distance: He doesn't come close, she doesn't invite him
- Eye contact: Broken frequently, both uncomfortable
- Exit: David looks back over shoulder (key visual)

**Author Style Reference**: Joe Abercrombie - tension through physical details, what's NOT said, glances and pauses carrying weight, short sharp exchanges

## Function in Arc

**Plot Function**:
- Accelerates timeline to exposure
- Creates witness who can report to security
- Increases stakes and paranoia
- Sets up David's later betrayal (passive or active)

**Character Function**:
- Shows Alexa under pressure - how she lies, improvises
- Reveals David's conflict between friendship and self-preservation
- Demonstrates fragility of Alexa's position
- First crack in her professional armor

**Theme Function**:
- Surveillance state - even colleagues are potential informants
- Isolation - can't trust anyone
- Class system - David's security vs Alexa's precarity
- Price of truth-seeking

**Arc Positioning**: Rising action. Investigation continuing but opposition forming. Noose tightening.

## Validation Notes

**Risks**:
- ⚠️ David could seem villainous if not written with genuine conflict
- ⚠️ Alexa's lie must be plausible enough that David's doubt feels earned, not stupid
- ⚠️ Tension could become melodramatic - keep grounded in professional awkwardness
- ⚠️ Over-explaining subtext in prose would kill tension

**Opportunities**:
- ✅ Physical details carry emotion (screen light on faces, distance between them, his backward glance)
- ✅ Pauses and silences as loud as words
- ✅ Ambiguity: reader unsure if David will report (matches Alexa's uncertainty)
- ✅ Callback to smalltalk scene - contrast between then and now

**Key Success Factors**:
- David's discomfort genuine - he doesn't want this confrontation
- Alexa's performance convincing on surface but reader sees her panic
- Ambiguous ending - did warning help or threaten her?
- Visual moment: his backward glance as he leaves = trust broken
- After he's gone: Alexa's reaction shows she knows she's exposed
