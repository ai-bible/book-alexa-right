## Subtext

**Surface Conversation**: Friendly office small-talk between colleagues

**Real Meaning**:
- David unconsciously displays his "full life" - family, stability, normalcy
- Alexa's deflections reveal isolation masked as professionalism
- The ease of David's life contrasts with Alexa's controlled performance

**Unsaid Elements**:
- David doesn't realize his family talk emphasizes Alexa's loneliness
- Alexa won't share personal life because there's nothing to share (work, gym, sleep, repeat)
- Both comfortable in their roles: he doesn't push, she doesn't open
- David's temporal security (65 years ahead) vs Alexa's 6 years unspoken

**Power Dynamic**: Equal professionally, but David's "normalcy" dominates conversationally. Alexa controls through brevity.

---

## Information Exchange

### David Learns
- Alexa successfully handled complex Volkov case (6-hour memory cascade)
- She's focused on work (nothing else shared)

### Alexa Learns
- David has family/partner and kids
- He spends weekends at parks, restaurants - normal life
- He's professionally aware (heard about her success)

### What Remains Hidden
- Alexa's complete isolation outside work
- David's family details don't register as painful to him
- Alexa's timer (6 years) vs his stability

### Information Consistency Check
✅ David knows Alexa is competent (established by her reputation)
✅ Neither knows what's coming (scene is pre-cat, pre-investigation)
✅ Alexa's short-timer status is visible (temporal bracelet) but not discussed

---

## Emotional Arc

**David**:
- Begins: Relaxed, friendly
- During: Comfortable, sharing openly
- Ends: Satisfied with social interaction, slightly puzzled by her brevity but not concerned

**Alexa**:
- Begins: Professional mode, between clients
- During: Brief pride (Volkov case), then deflection (personal topics)
- Ends: Polite mask maintained, returns to solitude

**Relationship Impact**: No change. This is baseline. The normalcy here will be destroyed later.

---

## Style Guidance

**Tone**: Light, ordinary, mundane - deliberately unremarkable

**Pacing**: Natural conversation rhythm, no urgency, comfortable pauses

**Dialogue Techniques**:
- Asymmetry: David talks more, Alexa responds economically
- Deflection: Alexa pivots personal to professional smoothly
- Contrast: His expansiveness vs her control

**Physical Choreography**:
- David: Relaxed body language, maybe holding coffee, leaning against doorway or desk
- Alexa: Focused on her work space, polite eye contact but ready to return to task
- Space: David enters her space casually; she doesn't invite him closer

**Author Style Reference**: Joe Abercrombie - short exchanges, physical details (David's coffee, Alexa's posture), show relationship through action not exposition

## Function in Arc

**Plot Function**: None directly - this is "before" snapshot

**Character Function**:
- Establishes Alexa's isolation beneath professional competence
- Shows David as "normal" - the life she can't have
- Creates baseline to measure her transformation against

**Theme Function**:
- Explores loneliness of short-timer existence
- Shows how "normalcy" (family, time, stability) is privilege
- Temporal inequality visible but unspoken (bracelet)

**Arc Positioning**: Opening normalcy, illusion of control. Everything stable before the fall.

## Validation Notes

**Risks**:
- ⚠️ Could become too expository if not careful
- ⚠️ Alexa might seem cold if deflection isn't written with subtlety
- ⚠️ David's family talk could seem tone-deaf - must be unconscious, not cruel

**Opportunities**:
- ✅ Contrast between surface (friendly) and depth (isolated)
- ✅ Physical details can show relationship without stating it
- ✅ Bracelet visible but not mentioned = show temporal inequality

**Key Success Factors**:
- Keep it short, ordinary, forgettable - this is the calm before storm
- Alexa's pride in Volkov case = last moment of professional confidence
- David's obliviousness is kind, not malicious
- Reader should feel Alexa's loneliness without her stating it
