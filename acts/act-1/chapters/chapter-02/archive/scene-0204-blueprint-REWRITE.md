# SCENE BLUEPRINT: 0204 "Редактирование памяти" (COMPLETE REWRITE)

**STATUS**: REWRITE - Replaces existing false version
**CRITICAL**: This scene reveals memory editing, false memories, and cognitive dissonance

---

## SCENE OVERVIEW

**Chapter**: 2, Scene 4
**Scene Name**: Редактирование памяти (Memory Editing)
**Structure Type**: Reactive Scene (Reaction-Dilemma-Decision variant)

**Scene Purpose**:
Show Alexa waking up after memory editing procedure. She has false memories of "successfully saving" Reginald, but glimpses of true memory (murder) break through. Creates cognitive dissonance and sets up revelation in scene 0205.

**What Actually Happened** (between 0203 and 0204):
1. End of 0203: Alexa murdered Reginald via neural override, her consciousness shut down
2. **TIME GAP (5 hours)**:
   - Corporation removed Reginald's body
   - Extracted stolen data from his memory
   - Mnemonic editing team arrived
   - Edited Alexa's memory, implanting false version
   - Staged the room to match false narrative
3. Start of 0204: Alexa "wakes up" with false memories

**What Alexa THINKS Happened** (false memory):
- Successful data extraction
- Reginald overdosed on memory collection (hedonist problem)
- She saved him, cleaned toxicity from his memory
- He regained consciousness, thanked her
- Everything ended well

**Truth Breaking Through**:
Fragments of real memory (flatline, "eliminate target", hands moving against her will, cat's final thought) flash through but don't make coherent sense to her.

---

## CORE CONFLICT

**External**: None (scene is internal/psychological)
**Internal**: Cognitive dissonance between false memory and true memory fragments
**Dramatic Question**: Why do her memories feel wrong? Why can't she remember 5 hours?

---

## SCENE PARAMETERS

**POV**: Alexa Chen (3rd person limited, tight POV)
**Location**: Reginald Havenford's bedroom, Golden Terrace residence
**Time**: Day 2, ~14:15 (after 5-hour gap from ~09:30)
**Duration**: ~20-25 minutes
**Estimated Word Count**: 1,400-1,800 words

**Emotional Arc**:
Disorientation → False satisfaction → Confusion → Relief (false) → Growing unease → Suppressed anxiety

**Tension Level**: ███████░░░ (70%) - Psychological tension, unreliable perception

---

## CONTEXT & CONTINUITY

**From Previous Scene (0203)**:
- Last thing Alexa remembers: Reginald's flatline, cat's thought "...кот...", darkness
- Neural interface shut down her consciousness at ~09:30
- She murdered Reginald by following override command

**To Next Scene (0205)**:
- Alexa leaves with false memories intact but uneasy
- In transport pod, receives work package with TRUE memory
- Moment of horrifying revelation

**Character State**:
- **Physical**: Groggy, metallic taste (sedation protocol aftereffects), heavy head
- **Mental**: Disoriented, false memories competing with fragments
- **Emotional**: Surface satisfaction masking deep unease
- **Time Bracket**: 6 years 108 days (was 6 years 47 days - gained +61 days)

---

## SCENE STRUCTURE

**Type**: REACTIVE (variant)
1. **Reaction**: Alexa wakes, tries to understand what happened
2. **Dilemma**: False memories vs. fragments - which is real?
3. **Decision**: Accepts false narrative, rationalizes inconsistencies (for now)

---

## BEAT BREAKDOWN

### Beat 1: AWAKENING - Disorientation (Est. 180-220 words)

**Type**: Scene Opening / Disorientation
**Purpose**: Establish cognitive fog, time gap, wrong-ness

**Action**:
Alexa regains consciousness. She's in Reginald's bedroom but something's different. The bed is empty. The "interface" device is gone. Everything is too clean, too quiet. Her head feels like it's filled with cotton wool, mouth tastes of metal.

**Physical Sensations**:
- Heavy eyelids (sedation aftereffects)
- Metallic taste on tongue (chemical residue)
- Dull pressure behind eyes
- Body feels disconnected, movements sluggish
- Air smells of ozone (stronger than normal)

**Reveals**:
- Time gap: Last remembered ~09:30, now shows 14:15 (5 hours missing)
- Room has been altered (bed empty, equipment removed, suspiciously clean)
- Alexa was unconscious/sedated during gap
- Her neural interface feels "quiet" (not normal post-procedure state)

**Dialogue/Action Ratio**: 0% dialogue, 100% internal perception/description

**Mood/Tone**: Dreamlike, disoriented, uncanny

**Key Details**:
- Temporal display shows 14:15:33
- Her hands are clean (should have residue from neural gel)
- Room temperature is precisely regulated (was warmer before)
- Silence is complete (medical monitors gone)

**Internal Monologue**:
"What happened? Why can't I remember? Last thing was... what was the last thing?"

**Ends With**: Alexa tries to access her memory of the procedure

---

### Beat 2: FALSE MEMORY - "Successful Extraction" (Est. 200-250 words)

**Type**: Exposition (false) / Memory Recall
**Purpose**: Show implanted memory in full clarity - TOO clear

**Action**:
Alexa "remembers" the procedure. Memory flows smoothly, vividly: extracting data, Reginald's overdose on collected memories (hedonist accumulation), her heroic work to save him, cleaning the toxicity, his grateful awakening.

**The False Memory** (as she experiences it):
- Data extraction going well
- Sudden alert: Reginald's consciousness fragmenting
- Discovered: decades of collected memories creating toxic loop
- She dove in, isolated the contamination
- Cleaned his neural pathways
- He stabilized, opened eyes, whispered "Thank you"
- Procedure ended successfully

**Reveals**:
- False memory is hyper-detailed (sign of fabrication)
- Too smooth, too perfect (real memories have gaps)
- Emotional content feels muted (edited emotions)
- Technical details too precise (implanted knowledge)

**Dialogue/Action Ratio**: 10% internal dialogue, 90% memory description

**Memory Quality Indicators** (for reader):
- Colors too vivid
- Timeline too linear
- Her own emotions described from outside ("she felt satisfied")
- No sensory confusion (real memories have mixed senses)

**Mood/Tone**: False clarity, artificial smoothness

**Internal Monologue**:
"Yes, that's what happened. The procedure was successful. I saved him. Why does it feel like I'm reading a report instead of remembering?"

**Ends With**: Memory ends cleanly at "successful completion" - but WHERE are the 5 hours?

---

### Beat 3: FRAGMENTS - True Memory Bleeding Through (Est. 180-220 words)

**Type**: Disruption / Psychological Horror
**Purpose**: Show true memory fragments breaking through, create cognitive dissonance

**Action**:
As Alexa tries to fill the 5-hour gap, other images flash unbidden. Brief, violent, terrifying. Flatline screaming. Hands moving against her will. A voice commanding "ELIMINATE TARGET." The cat's thought fragmenting into "...кот..." Death. But these images make no sense, don't fit the narrative.

**True Memory Fragments**:
1. **Visual**: Flatline on monitor (bright red, screaming alarm)
2. **Kinesthetic**: Her hands moving, but not by her command
3. **Auditory**: Voice in her head: "УСТРАНИТЬ ОБЪЕКТ" (ELIMINATE TARGET)
4. **Emotional**: Pure horror, complete helplessness
5. **Image**: Silver-gray cat with green eyes, fading
6. **Sensation**: Something dying under her touch

**Reveals**:
- True memory exists but fragmented
- Editing wasn't perfect (never is with trauma)
- Alexa's mind is trying to reconcile two versions
- The truth is too horrifying to integrate consciously

**Dialogue/Action Ratio**: 5% internal speech, 95% sensory flashes

**Physical Reaction**:
- Sharp intake of breath
- Hand flies to temple
- Nausea wave
- Temporal bracket flickers (neural stress)

**Mood/Tone**: Jagged, terrifying, fragmentary

**Internal Monologue**:
"What was that? Just artifacts. Sometimes fragments from the client's memory stick to the editor. Happens with damaged minds. Not real. Not MY memory."

**Ends With**: Alexa forcibly suppresses the fragments, rationalizes them away

---

### Beat 4: RATIONALIZATION - Professional Explanation (Est. 150-180 words)

**Type**: Defense Mechanism / Self-Deception
**Purpose**: Show Alexa actively choosing to believe false version

**Action**:
Alexa analyzes the fragments professionally. Conclusion: memory artifacts from Reginald's damaged consciousness. Sometimes when working with severely fragmented minds, bits of client memory "stick" to the editor's neural interface. She's experienced this before (has she?). Standard phenomenon. Nothing to worry about.

**Psychological Process**:
- Identifies inconsistency
- Generates explanation
- Accepts explanation (too readily)
- Suppresses doubt
- Reinforces false narrative

**Reveals**:
- Alexa is trained to rationalize
- She WANTS to believe the false version
- Cognitive dissonance is being actively managed (by her conscious mind)
- The explanation is plausible enough (to someone who wants to believe)

**Dialogue/Action Ratio**: 30% internal dialogue, 70% analytical thought

**Technical Details** (Alexa's reasoning):
- Memory contamination occurs in 3-7% of deep procedures
- Usually clears within 24 hours
- More common with traumatic or fragmented source memories
- Standard protocol: ignore, let neural cleanup processes handle it

**Mood/Tone**: Intellectual, controlled, defensive

**Internal Monologue**:
"Textbook contamination. I worked with a severely damaged mind - his memories bled into mine. Give it a day. It'll clear."

**Ends With**: Alexa convinced herself (almost), but unease remains in her body

---

### Beat 5: SEBASTIAN ENTERS - The Lie Delivered (Est. 220-280 words)

**Type**: Dialogue Scene / Deception
**Purpose**: Corporate representative delivers false narrative, Alexa receives "proof"

**Action**:
Sebastian Grey enters with his usual formal grace - but something is off. He thanks Alexa for saving Master Havenford. Explains Reginald is recovering in another wing of the residence, sends his gratitude. Presents her reward: 2 days off + 61 days transferred to her temporal bracket.

**Sebastian's Performance**:
- Formal, gracious, perfect words
- BUT: avoids direct eye contact (unusual for him)
- Hands have slight tremor (normally perfectly still)
- Stands farther away than usual
- Voice has forced warmth

**Dialogue**:
- Sebastian: "Miss Chen. Master Havenford wishes to express his profound gratitude."
- Sebastian: "Your swift action prevented a catastrophic neural cascade. He is recovering well."
- Sebastian: "He asked me to convey his thanks personally, along with a token of appreciation."
- Sebastian: "Two days of leave, and sixty-one days added to your bracket. The transfer is already complete."
- Alexa: "He's... he's well? The procedure was successful?"
- Sebastian: "Entirely successful, thanks to you. He is resting comfortably."

**Reveals**:
- Sebastian knows the truth (his discomfort betrays him)
- He's delivering a prepared script
- The reward is real (blood money)
- Reginald is definitely NOT in "another wing" (he's dead)
- Corporation is covering tracks methodically

**Dialogue/Action Ratio**: 65% dialogue, 35% action/observation

**Physical Details Alexa Notices** (but doesn't interpret correctly):
- Sebastian's left hand twitches once
- He looks at her forehead, not her eyes
- Takes half-step back when she stands
- Delivers the "gratitude" speech too smoothly (rehearsed)

**Temporal Bracket**:
- Before: 6 years 47 days
- After: 6 years 108 days
- +61 days = approximately 2 months of life

**Mood/Tone**: Formally cordial masking tension

**Alexa's Reaction**:
Relief (procedure worked!), gratitude (reward!), but... why does Sebastian seem uncomfortable?

**Ends With**: Alexa glances at her bracket - numbers confirm the transfer - "proof" everything went well

---

### Beat 6: WRONGNESS - Details Don't Fit (Est. 200-240 words)

**Type**: Observation / Mounting Unease
**Purpose**: Accumulate inconsistencies that Alexa notices but can't explain

**Action**:
As Sebastian escorts her out, Alexa notices details that don't fit. Guards in the corridor (weren't there before). Ozone smell too strong (multiple interface devices ran, not just one). A monitor in the corner shows "PROCEDURE COMPLETED" (which procedure?). The bedroom door has a security seal (new). Everything is slightly wrong.

**Inconsistencies Noticed**:
1. **Guards**: Two security personnel in corridor (weren't there on arrival)
2. **Ozone**: Air smells like after interface use, but TOO strong (multiple devices)
3. **Monitor**: Displays "ПРОЦЕДУРА ЗАВЕРШЕНА 14:07" (procedure completed 14:07)
   - Which procedure? Memory extraction ended at ~09:30... didn't it?
4. **Security seal**: Temporary bio-lock on bedroom door (why?)
5. **Silence**: Entire wing feels evacuated (where are servants?)
6. **Sebastian's route**: Takes her different way out (avoiding something?)

**Reveals**:
- Multiple procedures occurred during time gap
- Security was heightened (threat response)
- Area was locked down
- Something happened that required cleanup
- Sebastian is following containment protocol

**Dialogue/Action Ratio**: 40% dialogue, 60% observation

**Dialogue**:
- Alexa: "There are more guards than before."
- Sebastian: "Standard security rotation. Nothing unusual."
- Alexa: "What procedure completed at 14:07?"
- Sebastian: "Final system checks after neural work. Protocol."

**Physical Sensations** (Alexa's body knows something is wrong):
- Elevated heart rate
- Skin prickling
- Instinct screaming "danger"
- But conscious mind suppresses it

**Mood/Tone**: Growing paranoia, uncanny valley

**Internal Monologue**:
"Why am I looking for problems? The procedure was successful. I saved a man's life. I was rewarded. Everything makes sense. So why do I feel like I'm missing something critical?"

**Ends With**: They reach the transport pod - Alexa's chance to leave, to escape the wrongness

---

### Beat 7: DEPARTURE - Escape and Doubt (Est. 150-180 words)

**Type**: Transition / Internal Conflict
**Purpose**: Alexa leaves physically but psychological hooks are set

**Action**:
Sebastian sees her to the pod with formal courtesy - colder than usual? Or is she imagining it? She steps into the pod, door seals. As it descends, she watches the Golden Terrace recede. Should feel triumphant. Saved a life. Earned 61 days. Instead feels... hollow.

**Sebastian's Farewell**:
- "Safe journey, Miss Chen."
- "Enjoy your well-deserved rest."
- Turns away before pod door fully closes (dismissive? relieved?)

**Reveals**:
- Sebastian wants her gone (mission accomplished)
- Alexa senses the dismissal but misinterprets it
- Physical distance from crime scene doesn't resolve internal conflict
- She's taking the dissonance with her

**Dialogue/Action Ratio**: 20% dialogue, 80% internal/observation

**Pod Descent**:
- Golden Terrace rising above (tier 247-250)
- Her residential tier far below (tier 89)
- Vertical city between them (class divide made physical)
- Sunlight fading as she descends (metaphor)

**Physical State**:
- Exhaustion hitting now (adrenaline fading)
- Metallic taste persisting
- Headache building behind eyes
- Time gap still bothering her

**Mood/Tone**: Deflation, unresolved tension, dissatisfaction

**Internal Monologue**:
"I should be celebrating. Two months of life. A successful, difficult procedure. A man's life saved. So why does this feel like running away?"

**Ends With**: Transition to Beat 8 - alone with her thoughts

---

### Beat 8: TEMPORAL BRACKET - Physical Proof (Est. 120-150 words)

**Type**: Object Focus / Symbol
**Purpose**: Use physical evidence to heighten doubt - proof of "success" that feels wrong

**Action**:
Alone in pod, Alexa stares at her temporal bracket. Numbers glow: 6 years, 108 days. She watches the seconds tick down. Raises her hand, sees the silver band against her skin. 61 days. Two months of life. Tangible reward for... what exactly did she do?

**Temporal Bracket Details**:
- Silver band, seamless (biologically fused to wrist)
- Holographic display: years, days, hours, minutes, seconds
- Constant countdown (life draining)
- Transfer logged: 14:09:17 - 61 days credited
- Cannot be removed without killing the wearer

**Symbolic Weight**:
- Should represent success, reward
- Instead feels like payment for something she can't remember
- Blood money (literally - paid in life)
- Proof that something happened... but what?

**Reveals**:
- Transfer is real (corporation keeps its promises)
- Timing: 14:09 (2 minutes after "procedure completed" at 14:07)
- Everything documented, official, irreversible
- She accepted the payment (complicit now, whether she knows or not)

**Dialogue/Action Ratio**: 0% dialogue, 100% internal reflection

**Physical Action**:
- Touches bracket with opposite hand
- Feels warmth (biometric integration)
- Watches seconds count down: ...06, ...05, ...04...
- Each second = piece of her life

**Emotional Response**:
Should feel: gratitude, satisfaction, security
Actually feels: unease, hollowness, wrongness

**Mood/Tone**: Contemplative, unsettled, symbolic

**Internal Monologue**:
"Sixty-one days. Each one supposed to be precious. Why do they feel like evidence?"

**Ends With**: Alexa tries to remember details of the "successful procedure"

---

### Beat 9: MEMORY TEST - Trying to Remember (Est. 150-180 words)

**Type**: Internal Investigation / Failed Recall
**Purpose**: Show Alexa actively questioning, but hitting walls

**Action**:
Alexa closes her eyes, tries to trace the memory step-by-step. Extract data... Reginald's overdose... saving him... his gratitude. The narrative is smooth, clear, detailed. TOO detailed. Real memories have gaps, uncertainty, sensory confusion. This memory feels like watching a recording, not living an experience.

**Memory Analysis**:
- Tests recall: can she remember smells? (generic ozone)
- Can she remember exact words? (yes - too exact)
- Can she remember her own emotions? (described, not felt)
- Can she remember time passing? (no - just... completed)
- Can she remember the 5-hour gap? (nothing - complete blank)

**Professional Knowledge** (Alexa knows signs of edited memory):
1. Over-clarity (compensation for fabrication)
2. Emotional flatness (edited emotions don't integrate well)
3. Linear narrative (real experience is messy)
4. Missing sensory details (fabrication focuses on visual/auditory)
5. Time gaps (editing requires consciousness suppression)

**Reveals**:
- Alexa has the knowledge to identify edited memory
- She's applying it to her own recall
- Cognitive dissonance intensifying
- But she CANNOT accept the conclusion (too terrifying)

**Dialogue/Action Ratio**: 15% internal dialogue, 85% analytical thought

**Physical Response**:
- Frown deepening
- Headache worsening
- Nausea returning
- Hand on temple (pressure point)

**Mood/Tone**: Intellectual investigation fighting emotional denial

**Internal Monologue**:
"It's just stress. Complex procedure, exhausting work, contamination from his fragmented mind. My memory feels odd because I'm tired. That's all. That's... all."

**Key Moment**:
She ALMOST realizes the truth - then pulls back from the edge

**Ends With**: Alexa forcibly stops analyzing, looks out pod window instead

---

### Beat 10: CAT FRAGMENT - Image Without Context (Est. 120-150 words)

**Type**: Mystery Hook / Foreshadowing
**Purpose**: Plant specific detail that will become critical in next scene

**Action**:
As Alexa stares out the window, watching tiers slide past, an image surfaces unbidden. A cat. Silver-gray fur, green eyes, intelligent gaze. Looking at her. Then... fading. Dying? The image is visceral, painful, REAL. But where does it come from? Reginald didn't have a cat. Did he?

**The Cat Image**:
- Silver-gray fur (precise color)
- Green eyes (vivid, aware)
- Expression: trust, then betrayal, then... nothing
- Sensation: connection breaking (death of consciousness)
- Emotion: grief (not hers? whose?)
- Thought fragment: "...кот..." (cat)

**Reveals**:
- This is Reginald's last thought (his dying memory)
- Alexa was connected when he died (she felt it)
- This memory is REAL (unlike the false narrative)
- Cat represents something important (will be explained in 0205)
- True memory is breaking through in fragments

**Dialogue/Action Ratio**: 5% internal dialogue, 95% sensory experience

**Physical Response**:
- Tears (unexplained)
- Chest tightness
- Grief (not her own)
- Confusion (why is she crying?)

**Mood/Tone**: Melancholic, mysterious, emotionally raw

**Internal Monologue**:
"A cat? Why would I remember a cat? I don't remember any cat. Was it his? A memory? His memory? But why would I... Stop. Stop thinking. Just... stop."

**Ends With**: Alexa wipes tears, forces herself to focus on something else (anything else)

---

### Beat 11: CLOSING - False Resolution (Est. 100-130 words)

**Type**: Scene Close / Temporary Denial
**Purpose**: End on Alexa choosing (for now) to accept false narrative - but doubt planted

**Action**:
Pod approaching her tier (89). Alexa takes deep breath, straightens. Successful procedure. Client saved. Reward earned. Two days off to rest. She repeats this narrative like a mantra. Almost believes it. The unease settles into her stomach like a stone, but she can ignore it. She's good at ignoring things. Has to be.

**Resolution** (temporary):
- Alexa chooses false narrative (consciously)
- Suppresses doubt (willfully)
- Compartmentalizes inconsistencies (trained response)
- Accepts reward without examining cost
- Prepares to return to normal life

**Reveals**:
- Alexa is complicit in her own deception (makes later revelation more painful)
- She has capacity for self-deception (survival skill in this world)
- The unease won't stay buried (foreshadowing)
- She KNOWS something is wrong but refuses to look

**Dialogue/Action Ratio**: 0% dialogue, 100% internal

**Physical State**:
- Straightens posture (false confidence)
- Wipes face (removing evidence of tears)
- Checks bracket one more time (seeking reassurance)
- Prepares professional mask

**Mood/Tone**: Forced calm, fragile resolution, denial

**Internal Monologue**:
"Everything is fine. The procedure was successful. I'm going home. I have two days off. Sixty-one days earned. Everything is fine. Everything is—"

**Final Image**:
Pod door opens to her tier. Familiar ground. Safety. Lies.

**Ends With**: Hook for scene 0205 - she'll receive the work package with TRUE memory soon

---

```

**Pacing Strategy**: Wave pattern - false calm disrupted by fragments, returns to false calm, but each wave leaves more doubt

---

## DIALOGUE NOTES

### Alexa's Internal Voice
- Analytical when comfortable (professional distance)
- Fragmentary when stressed (incomplete thoughts)
- Repetitive when denying (mantras, reassurance)
- Clinical when defending (technical explanations)
- **Key pattern**: Questions herself, then shuts down questions

**Example patterns**:
- "What happened? No, I remember. I remember... don't I?"
- "Standard phenomenon. Textbook. Nothing unusual."
- "Everything is fine. Everything is fine. Everything is—"

### Sebastian's Voice
- Formal, aristocratic diction
- Rehearsed gratitude (too smooth)
- Deflective responses (doesn't quite answer questions)
- Shorter sentences than usual (discomfort)
- **Key pattern**: Says correct words but avoids connection

**Example patterns**:
- "Master Havenford wishes to express..." (third person, distancing)
- "Standard protocol." (dismissive non-answer)
- "Safe journey." (formulaic, wants her gone)

### Subtext
- **Sebastian**: "Please leave so I can stop lying to your face"
- **Alexa**: "I want to believe you so badly I'll ignore everything wrong"

**Power Dynamic**:
- Sebastian has information (but must conceal)
- Alexa has suspicion (but must suppress)
- Both performing roles neither believes

---

## SENSORY DETAILS TO INCLUDE

### Physical Sensations (Alexa's body remembers what her mind forgets)
- **Metallic taste**: Chemical residue from sedation (persistent)
- **Heavy head**: Cotton-wool feeling (consciousness suppression aftermath)
- **Nausea**: Body rejecting false memories (psychosomatic)
- **Chest tightness**: Anxiety she won't acknowledge
- **Headache**: Neural stress from conflicting memories
- **Skin prickling**: Instinctive threat response

### Environmental Details
- **Ozone smell**: Sharp, too strong (multiple interfaces used)
- **Silence**: Absence of medical monitors (removed)
- **Air temperature**: Precisely regulated (clinical)
- **Light**: Slightly dimmed (post-procedure protocol)
- **Emptiness**: No servants, no sounds (area evacuated)

### Visual Markers
- **Empty bed**: Reginald gone (body removed)
- **Missing equipment**: interface device removed
- **Clean surfaces**: Too clean (evidence erased)
- **Security seal**: Glowing bio-lock (containment)
- **Guards**: Two in corridor (threat response)
- **Monitor**: "PROCEDURE COMPLETED 14:07" (wrong timestamp)

### Temporal Details
- **Bracket glow**: Silver light, holographic numbers
- **Countdown**: Seconds ticking (...06, ...05, ...04...)
- **Time gap**: 09:30 → 14:15 (5 hours missing)
- **Transfer timestamp**: 14:09:17 (logged evidence)

---

## WORLD-BUILDING INTEGRATION

### Memory Editing Technology
**Show naturally through Alexa's experience:**

1. **Sedation Protocol**:
   - Consciousness suppression required for deep editing
   - Leaves metallic taste, cognitive fog
   - Duration: several hours for complex edits

2. **Signs of Edited Memory**:
   - Over-clarity (fabricated details too perfect)
   - Emotional flatness (edited emotions don't integrate)
   - Linear narrative (real memory is non-linear)
   - Time gaps (editing requires downtime)
   - Alexa KNOWS these signs (professional knowledge)

3. **Memory Contamination** (Alexa's false explanation):
   - Real phenomenon (her rationalization is plausible)
   - Client memories can "stick" to editor
   - Usually clears in 24 hours
   - More common with damaged/traumatic sources

4. **Limits of Editing**:
   - Cannot completely erase traumatic memories (fragments remain)
   - Emotional memories harder to edit (body remembers)
   - Requires time and expertise (mnemonic editing team)
   - Imperfect (why fragments break through)

### Temporal Economy
**Integrate through bracket details:**

- Life measured in years, days, hours, minutes, seconds
- Constant countdown (existential pressure)
- 61 days = significant reward (~2 months life)
- Transfer is instantaneous, logged, irreversible
- Cannot be refused once transferred (acceptance is automatic)
- Creates complicity (she accepted payment for unknown action)

### Social Hierarchy
**Show through Sebastian's behavior:**

- Formal distance between classes (Sebastian never informal)
- Memory editor as service professional (skilled but subordinate)
- Golden Terrace vs. Tier 89 (class divide literally vertical)
- Corporate power over individual (Sebastian serves corporation, not truth)
- Disposability of workers (Alexa's memory edited without consent)

---

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Must Include
1. **Time gap explicitly noted**: 09:30 → 14:15 (5 hours lost)
2. **False memory in full**: Complete narrative of "successful save"
3. **True memory fragments**: Flatline, override command, cat's death
4. **Alexa's rationalization**: Professional explanation for fragments
5. **Sebastian's tells**: Averted gaze, tremor, coldness
6. **Environmental wrongness**: Guards, ozone, monitors, seals
7. **Temporal bracket**: 6y 47d → 6y 108d (+61 days)
8. **Cat image**: Silver-gray, green eyes, dying
9. **Cognitive dissonance**: Alexa notices but suppresses
10. **False resolution**: She CHOOSES to believe lie (for now)

### Must Avoid
1. **Direct exposition**: Don't explain memory editing directly (show through experience)
2. **Obvious tells**: Alexa shouldn't consciously suspect murder (yet)
3. **Sebastian breaking**: He maintains professional facade (barely)
4. **Resolution**: No real resolution (scene ends with suppressed doubt)
5. **Revelation**: Truth revealed in NEXT scene, not this one
6. **Heavy-handed**: Wrongness should be subtle, accumulating
7. **Loss of POV**: Stay tight in Alexa's unreliable perception

### Setup for Future
1. **Cat image**: Will be explained in 0205 (Reginald's pet, last thought)
2. **Memory fragments**: Will coalesce into truth when she sees real memory
3. **Sebastian's guilt**: Will become relevant later (knows truth)
4. **Temporal bracket**: Payment creates moral/legal complicity
5. **Body memory**: Physical reactions persist even when mind forgets
6. **Cognitive dissonance**: Foundation for psychological breakdown
7. **False narrative**: Corporation's version she'll have to publicly maintain

## TRANSITION NOTES

### From Previous Scene (0203)
**What carries over emotionally/contextually:**
- Last conscious moment: Reginald's flatline, cat's dying thought
- Neural override forced her to murder
- Interface shut down her consciousness
- Trauma exists even if memory edited
- Body remembers what mind forgets

**Continuity markers:**
- Same location (Reginald's bedroom)
- But altered (cleaned, evidence removed)
- Time gap is THE key clue
- Physical sensations persist (metallic taste = sedation)

### To Next Scene (0205)
**What this scene sets up:**
- Alexa leaves with false memories (fragile)
- Cognitive dissonance established (growing)
- Cat image planted (will be explained)
- Temporal bracket payment (complicity)
- In pod/home, receives work package
- **REVELATION**: Package contains TRUE memory of extraction
- She'll experience moment of horrifying clarity

**Emotional transition:**
- From: Suppressed doubt (this scene)
- To: Inescapable knowledge (next scene)
- Trigger: Corporation sends her own memory as "work sample"
- Irony: They don't know she was memory-edited (different departments)

**Hooks planted:**
1. What happened during 5-hour gap? (answered: memory editing)
2. Why fragments of different memory? (answered: true memory bleeding through)
3. What is the cat? (answered: Reginald's pet, his last thought)
4. Why does success feel like failure? (answered: it WAS failure - murder)
5. Can she trust her own memory? (answered: NO)

## TECHNICAL WRITING NOTES

### POV Management
**Tight 3rd person limited (Alexa):**
- Only what she perceives (unreliable)
- Only what she thinks (defensive)
- Only what she feels (body knows more than mind)
- Reader sees MORE than she does (dramatic irony)

**Techniques:**
- Sensory details filtered through her interpretation (often wrong)
- Internal monologue showing rationalization process
- Physical reactions she doesn't understand (body truth)
- Observations she notices but misinterprets

### Unreliable Perception
**How to show:**
1. **False memory**: Presented as real to HER, but "too perfect" for reader
2. **Fragments**: Jagged, visceral, MORE real than false memory
3. **Interpretations**: Alexa explains away wrongness (reader sees through)
4. **Contradictions**: She holds both versions without integrating them

**Stylistic markers:**
- False memory: Smooth prose, past tense, distanced ("she felt")
- True fragments: Present tense, sharp images, visceral ("hands moving NOW")
- Rationalization: Controlled sentences, technical language
- Doubt: Fragmented sentences, questions, repetition

### Sentence Structure for Psychological State

**Disorientation (Beat 1):**
- Short, choppy sentences
- Questions without answers
- Sensory confusion
- Example: "Where? When? What happened?"

**False Memory (Beat 2):**
- Longer, flowing sentences
- Too smooth, too organized
- Passive constructions ("was completed")
- Example: "The procedure had gone well, data extracted cleanly, consciousness preserved."

**Fragments Breaking Through (Beat 3):**
- Sentence fragments
- Em-dashes for interruption
- Italics for intrusive thoughts
- Example: "Flatline—screaming alarm—hands not hers—ELIMINATE TARGET—no no no—"

**Rationalization (Beat 4):**
- Technical, complex sentences
- Professional terminology
- Logical connectors ("therefore," "because")
- Example: "Memory contamination occurs in approximately 3-7% of deep neural procedures, particularly when the source consciousness exhibits severe fragmentation or trauma."

**Denial (Beat 11):**
- Repetitive structure
- Mantras
- Incomplete thoughts breaking off
- Example: "Everything is fine. The procedure was successful. Everything is fine. Everything is—"

### Dialogue Formatting

**Sebastian's scripted responses:**
- Formal register
- Complete sentences
- Third person references ("Master Havenford")
- Lack of contractions

**Alexa's questions:**
- Seeking reassurance
- Easily deflected
- Don't push hard (she WANTS to believe)

**Subtext indicators:**
- Action beats showing contradiction (says X, does Y)
- Physical tells (tremor while speaking calmly)
- Word choice (formal = distancing)

### Symbolism

**Temporal Bracket:**
- Physical proof (can't deny transfer happened)
- Payment (creates complicity)
- Countdown (constant reminder of mortality)
- Evidence (logged, traceable, real)
- Question: payment for WHAT?

**Cat Image:**
- Reginald's last thought (his consciousness dying)
- Connection between Alexa and victim
- Beauty dying (silver-gray, green eyes)
- Innocence lost (trust → betrayal)
- Memory that won't stay buried

**Ozone Smell:**
- "interface" devices (memory technology)
- Too strong (multiple devices = multiple procedures)
- Lingering evidence (can't be cleaned away)
- Sensory truth (body knows)

**Empty Bed:**
- Absence (Reginald gone)
- Crime scene cleaned (evidence erased)
- Death not visible (but happened)
- Space where truth should be

---

## STYLE GUIDELINES

### Tone: Psychological Thriller
- **Unreliable perception** (what Alexa thinks vs. what's true)
- **Mounting dread** (details accumulating wrongness)
- **Cognitive dissonance** (holding contradictory truths)
- **Paranoia** (is she imagining things? no, but she thinks so)
- **Fragile denial** (choosing lie over unbearable truth)

### Atmosphere: Uncanny Valley
- Everything correct but WRONG
- Familiar space made strange (same room, different)
- Social interaction just slightly off (Sebastian's tells)
- Memory that feels like someone else's
- Success that tastes like failure

### Prose Style
**Rhythm:**
- Vary sentence length for psychological state
- Short for panic/disorientation
- Long for false memory/rationalization
- Fragments for intrusive truth

**Imagery:**
- Clinical/technological (ozone, monitors, brackets)
- Organic/body (metallic taste, nausea, tears)
- Contrast sterile environment with visceral reactions

**Repetition:**
- Use for mantras ("Everything is fine")
- Use for obsessive details (checking bracket multiple times)
- Use for questions that won't go away ("What happened?")

### Language Register
**Technical (when Alexa is comfortable):**
- Professional terminology
- Analytical distance
- Complex sentences

**Fragmented (when truth intrudes):**
- Incomplete thoughts
- Sensory flashes
- Present tense intrusions

**Defensive (when rationalizing):**
- Logical structures
- "Standard," "normal," "protocol"
- Passive constructions (avoiding agency)

## SCENE OUTCOME

### What Alexa Knows (consciously)
- Procedure was successful (FALSE)
- She saved Reginald Havenford (FALSE)
- He's recovering in another wing (FALSE)
- She earned 61 days as reward (TRUE - but for murder, not saving)
- Some memory contamination from his damaged mind (FALSE explanation for TRUE fragments)

### What Alexa Suspects (suppressed)
- Something happened during 5-hour gap (TRUE)
- Memory feels wrong (TRUE)
- Details don't quite fit (TRUE)
- Sebastian acting strange (TRUE)
- But: rationalizes all of it away (DENIAL)

### What Alexa Doesn't Know (yet)
- She murdered Reginald (will learn in 0205)
- Her memory was edited (will infer in 0205)
- Fragments are REAL memory (will realize in 0205)
- Corporation used her as weapon (will understand in 0205)
- She's complicit in murder she doesn't remember (will devastate her in 0205)

### What Reader Knows
- Alexa's memory is false (editing occurred)
- Fragments are true memory breaking through
- Reginald is dead (not "recovering")
- Corporation orchestrated everything
- Alexa is victim AND unwitting perpetrator
- Revelation is coming (dramatic irony)

## CONNECTION TO LARGER NARRATIVE

### Immediate Context
- **Scene 0203**: Murder occurs, consciousness shut down
- **Scene 0204**: THIS SCENE - memory edited, false reality accepted
- **Scene 0205**: Truth revealed through work package

### Act 1 Arc
- **Rising question**: Can Alexa trust her own memory?
- **This scene's role**: Establishes that answer is NO
- **Consequence**: Everything she thinks she knows is suspect

### Character Development
- **Alexa's complicity**: She CHOOSES to believe (active denial)
- **Survival mechanism**: Rationalization protects from unbearable truth
- **Professional knowledge**: She could recognize edited memory but doesn't want to
- **Foundation for breakdown**: When truth emerges, denial collapses

### Thematic Development
- **Memory as identity**: If memory is false, who is she?
- **Corporate control**: Even her mind isn't her own
- **Technological horror**: Used as weapon without knowing
- **Moral complexity**: Victim of editing but guilty of murder

## FINAL NOTES FOR PROSE ARCHITECT

### Voice
This scene requires:
- Tight POV (Alexa's unreliable perception)
- Psychological realism (denial mechanisms)
- Sensory grounding (body knows truth)
- Controlled pacing (mounting unease)

### Key Moments to Emphasize
1. **Awakening**: Disorientation, time gap noticed
2. **False memory presentation**: Too perfect, reader sees it's false
3. **First fragment**: Visceral shock, then suppression
4. **Sebastian's eyes**: Moment he can't meet her gaze
5. **Bracket transfer**: Physical proof creating complicity
6. **Cat image**: Unexplained grief, mystery hook
7. **Final denial**: Active choice to believe lie

### Emotional Throughline
Start: Confused fog
Build: False satisfaction → fragments → rationalization → unease
Peak: Cat image (grief)
End: Suppressed terror masked as calm

### Reader Experience
- Dramatic irony (we know more than Alexa)
- Mounting dread (seeing her denial)
- Anticipation (revelation coming)
- Sympathy (she's victim even as she denies it)

---

**TOTAL ESTIMATED WORD COUNT**: 1,400-1,800 words (11 beats averaging 127-164 words each)

**CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTOR**:
Reader must understand memory editing occurred while Alexa does not. Her denial must feel psychologically real, not stupid. Sebastian's guilt must be visible but subtle. False memory must feel false to reader but real to Alexa.

**NEXT SCENE SETUP**:
Scene 0205 delivers the revelation - work package contains TRUE extraction memory. Alexa experiences moment of horrifying clarity. Everything she "remembered" was a lie. Everything she dismissed as "contamination" was truth. She murdered a man and can't remember doing it.

## APPENDIX: Technical Reference

### Memory Editing Procedure (what happened during 5-hour gap)

**Phase 1: Sedation (09:30-10:00)**
- Neural interface administered sedation protocol
- Alexa's consciousness suppressed
- Memory state frozen at moment of shutdown

**Phase 2: Body Removal (10:00-10:30)**
- Reginald's body extracted from residence
- Crime scene cleaned and reset
- Equipment reconfigured for editing procedure

**Phase 3: Memory Editing (10:30-13:30)**
- Mnemonic editing team arrived
- Identified traumatic memory segments (murder)
- Constructed false narrative (heroic save)
- Implanted false memory, suppressed true memory
- Cannot completely erase (fragments remain)

**Phase 4: Recovery (13:30-14:07)**
- Gradual consciousness restoration
- Memory integration (false narrative becomes "real")
- Physical recovery from sedation
- Final system checks

**Phase 5: Delivery (14:07-14:15)**
- Alexa regains full consciousness
- Sebastian delivers prepared script
- Temporal bracket transfer (61 days)
- Containment complete

### Signs of Memory Editing (that Alexa knows but won't apply to herself)

1. **Over-clarity**: Fabricated memories compensate with excessive detail
2. **Emotional flatness**: Edited emotions don't integrate naturally
3. **Linear narrative**: Real memories are non-linear, multi-sensory, messy
4. **Time gaps**: Editing requires consciousness suppression (leaves blank periods)
5. **Physical aftereffects**: Metallic taste, fog, headache (sedation protocol)
6. **Resistance fragments**: Traumatic memories leave traces that break through
7. **Body memory**: Physical/emotional responses persist even when mental memory edited

### Temporal Bracket System

**Function**: Tracks remaining lifespan
**Display**: Years, days, hours, minutes, seconds (constant countdown)
**Transfer**: Instantaneous, logged, irreversible
**Standard rates**:
- Week of work: ~3-7 days earned
- Complex procedure: 10-30 days typical
- 61 days: VERY generous (suspicious if Alexa were thinking clearly)

**Legal status**:
- Transfer acceptance automatic (cannot refuse)
- Creates contractual completion (procedure "accepted" as successful)
- Payment = evidence of service rendered
- In this case: Blood money (literally)
