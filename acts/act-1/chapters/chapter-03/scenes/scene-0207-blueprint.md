**Chapter**: 02
**Act**: 1
**POV Character**: Alexa
**Location**: Alexa's apartment, Floor 247
**Time**: Late evening/night, Day 2
**Estimated Word Count**: 1,000-1,500 words

**Structure Type**: PROACTIVE (Goal-Conflict-Disaster)

---

## SCENE OVERVIEW

### Context from Previous Scene (0206)
Alexa discovered her memory has been edited. Physical and emotional paralysis. Made it home. Decided to check what else has been changed.

### Scene Goal
Alexa methodically checks her memories for other inconsistencies. Professionalism against panic. Transition from emotional reaction to analytical work.

### Scene Conflict
- **External**: Technical challenge of reviewing her own memories without alerting corporate monitoring
- **Internal**: Fighting panic and dissociation while maintaining professional detachment

### Scene Disaster (No-And)
- Alexa confirms multiple memories are intact (partial relief)
- But discovers the "real" version contains a detail about a silver-grey cat with green eyes
- This detail is absent from the false version
- Realizes the cat is a key to something important she doesn't understand yet
- New problem: What does the cat mean? Why was this detail removed?

---

## EMOTIONAL CONTEXT

### Opening Emotional State
- Controlled panic (Gillian Flynn's "cool girl" mask over terror)
- Professional detachment as coping mechanism
- Determination to know the full truth

### Emotional Arc
```
Controlled Fear → Clinical Analysis → Brief Hope → Unsettling Discovery → New Dread
████░░░░░░ (40%) → ██████░░░░ (60%) → ████░░░░░░ (40%) → ████████░░ (80%) → ██████████ (100%)
```

### Closing Emotional State
- Detective focus activated
- Underlying terror about what the cat detail means
- Commitment to investigate further

---

## BEAT BREAKDOWN

### Beat 1: Technical Setup (Est. 150-200 words)
**Type**: Goal Establishment
**Purpose**: Show Alexa's professionalism, introduce home "interface" system

**Action**:
Alexa enters her apartment, bypassing evening routines. Moves directly to her bedroom workspace. Activates the personal neural interface - a sleeker, smaller version of the corporate "interface" she uses for clients. This one is private, unmonitored (supposedly).

**Technical Details**:
- Personal neural interface: compact device, connects via temple sensors
- Home version lacks full corporate monitoring (or so she believes)
- Activation sequence: biometric scan, neural handshake, interface initialization
- Visual: soft blue glow, minimal haptic feedback
- Her hands shake slightly as she calibrates the connection

**Reveals**:
- Alexa has professional-grade equipment at home
- She knows how to use it on herself (dangerous, usually requires operator)
- She's willing to risk solo neural diving despite protocol violations
- Physical signs of stress breaking through control (trembling hands)

**Dialogue/Action Ratio**: 5% dialogue (internal), 95% action/description

**Mood/Tone**: Clinical, precise, underlaid with suppressed panic

**Key Internal Dialogue**:
- *Treat yourself as a client. Just another memory audit. Standard procedure.*
- *Except it's not standard. Except it's you.*

**Ends With**: Neural interface activated, Alexa preparing to dive into her own mindscape

---

### Beat 2: Diving Into Memory (Est. 200-250 words)
**Type**: Conflict Introduction
**Purpose**: Show the subjective experience of memory diving, establish the "space" of memory

**Action**:
Alexa initiates the dive. Her consciousness fragments, splits - one part experiencing, one part observing. The bedroom fades. She's suddenly standing in the non-space of her own memory architecture.

**Technical Details**:
- Memory appears as a vast, dark space with floating fragments of light
- Each light = a memory cluster (chronological, emotional, sensory groupings)
- Navigation is semi-intuitive: think of a time/person/place, relevant memories brighten
- Editing appears as "seams" - discontinuities in the natural flow
- Time feels elastic, subjective

**Visualization**:
- Darkness punctuated by constellation-like memory clusters
- Recent memories glow brighter (still "warm")
- Childhood memories are distant, dimmer stars
- One cluster pulses with artificial brightness - the edited Reginald memory
- The seam around it is visible now that she knows to look: edges too sharp, colors too saturated

**Reveals**:
- The subjective experience of memory diving (for reader world-building)
- How memory editing appears from the inside
- Alexa's familiarity with this process (but never on herself)

**Sensory Details**:
- No sound in memory space (absolute silence)
- Temperature neutral, but emotional memories generate phantom sensations
- Floating sensation, no proprioception
- Disorientation fighting with professional training

**Dialogue/Action Ratio**: 10% internal dialogue, 90% description/action

**Internal Monologue**:
- *There. The Reginald memory cluster. Too bright. Too perfect. Artificial.*
- *What else? What else did they touch?*

**Ends With**: Alexa navigating toward her earliest memories - childhood at the orphanage

---

### Beat 3: Checking Childhood Memories (Est. 150-200 words)
**Type**: Development - Partial Relief
**Purpose**: Establish some memories are intact, create contrast for later discovery

**Action**:
Alexa reaches for her childhood memories. The orphanage. First vivid memory: age six, cold tile floor, other children's voices echoing. She examines the memory carefully, looking for seams, discontinuities.

**Memory Details - Orphanage**:
- Sensory intact: cold floor, industrial disinfectant smell, fluorescent buzz
- Emotional resonance feels genuine: loneliness, determination to be invisible
- No artificial edges
- Memory flows naturally into adjacent memories

**Verification Process**:
- Checks emotional valence (does fear feel "real"?)
- Examines sensory details (are they consistent with known childhood perception?)
- Looks for temporal markers (do events sequence logically?)
- Searches for seams (are edges natural or artificial?)

**Result**:
Childhood appears untouched. Relief floods through her - they didn't take everything.

**Reveals**:
- Not all of Alexa's memories have been edited
- Her childhood trauma is genuine (oddly comforting)
- The corporation targeted specific memories, not wholesale replacement

**Dialogue/Action Ratio**: 15% internal dialogue, 85% description

**Internal Monologue**:
- *Intact. This is real. This happened.*
- *They left my foundation alone. Why? Control? Efficiency?*
- *Or did they only edit what threatened them?*

**Ends With**: Moving forward chronologically toward more recent memories

---

### Beat 4: Checking Professional Memories (Est. 150-200 words)
**Type**: Development - Building Tension
**Purpose**: Establish pattern of what's intact vs. edited

**Action**:
Alexa examines key professional memories. First day at the corporation. Early training. Recent client sessions. Most appear intact - natural edges, genuine emotional resonance, logical flow.

**Checked Memories**:
1. **First day at corporation** (8 years ago):
   - Intact: nervousness, determination, signing contracts
   - Natural flow, genuine emotions

2. **Neural interface training** (7 years ago):
   - Intact: fascination, first time diving into someone else's memory
   - Mentor's warnings about ethical boundaries

3. **Recent client sessions** (past 3 months):
   - Mostly intact
   - Standard work memories: tired faces, routine extractions
   - Nothing extraordinary

**Pattern Recognition**:
- Routine memories: untouched
- Childhood: untouched
- Reginald: heavily edited
- What else?

**Reveals**:
- The editing was surgical, not comprehensive
- They targeted specific memories related to Reginald
- Alexa's professional skill set is genuine (some relief)

**Dialogue/Action Ratio**: 20% internal dialogue, 80% description

**Internal Monologue**:
- *They were precise. Surgical. Just the Reginald encounter.*
- *But what if there's more? What if I'm missing the edited memories because they're seamless?*
- *No. Focus. Compare the two versions systematically.*

**Ends With**: Returning to the Reginald memory cluster, preparing for detailed comparison

---

### Beat 5: Comparing Memory Versions - FALSE VERSION (Est. 200-250 words)
**Type**: Conflict Escalation
**Purpose**: Detailed examination of the implanted false memory

**Action**:
Alexa deliberately enters the false version of the Reginald memory. Experiencing it fully, cataloging every detail.

**FALSE VERSION - Full Details**:

**Setting**:
- Penthouse suite, Floor 298
- Opulent: marble floors, floor-to-ceiling windows showing city lights
- Antique furniture: red velvet chaise lounge, mahogany desk
- Walls lined with crystal storage units - each containing archived memories (visual: glowing neural patterns suspended in glass)

**Reginald's Appearance**:
- Late 50s, silver hair perfectly styled
- Expensive suit: charcoal grey, silk lapels
- Face: relaxed, slightly flushed, hedonistic smile
- Eyes: dilated, glassy (drug effect)
- Posture: lounging on the chaise, languid

**The Encounter**:
- Alexa arrives for "extraction" appointment
- Reginald offers her wine (she declines)
- He talks about his collection: "Memories of pleasure. I collect only the finest moments."
- Shows her his favorite: a memory of sunrise over Old Earth (impossibly expensive, black market)
- He's high on temporal drugs, mixing memory playback with stimulants
- Becomes erratic, confused between his memories and reality
- Overdose: sudden collapse, seizure, neural feedback surge
- Alexa calls emergency medical, tries to stabilize him
- He dies before help arrives
- Official verdict: accidental overdose during memory playback

**Key Details in False Version**:
- Reginald as collector of experiences
- Surrounded by luxury, decadence
- His death as tragic accident
- Alexa as professional who tried to help
- NO mention of: laboratory, research, cat, codes, conspiracy

**Emotional Tone of False Memory**:
- Pity for Reginald (wasteful death)
- Professional frustration (couldn't save him)
- Mild disgust at hedonism
- No guilt, no complicity

**Reveals**:
- How sophisticated the false memory is (detailed, sensory-rich)
- The narrative they wanted Alexa to believe
- The emotional response they engineered (pity, not guilt)

**Dialogue/Action Ratio**: 40% dialogue (remembered), 60% description

**Key Dialogue (False Version)**:
- Reginald: "Each memory in my collection is a masterpiece. This one—sunrise over Old Earth—cost me fifteen years of salary. Worth every credit."
- Reginald: "Do you ever keep copies, Alexa? The memories you extract? The temptation must be exquisite."
- Alexa: "That would be a violation of protocol."
- Reginald: (laughing) "Protocol. Such a beautiful word for a cage."

**Ends With**: Alexa pulling out of the false memory, preparing to compare with the real version

---

### Beat 6: Comparing Memory Versions - TRUE VERSION (Est. 200-250 words)
**Type**: Turning Point
**Purpose**: Detailed examination of the recovered real memory, discovery of the cat detail

**Action**:
Alexa shifts to the "real" memory - the one recovered from her subconscious. The contrast is immediate and stark.

**TRUE VERSION - Full Details**:

**Setting**:
- Sublevel laboratory, Floor 163 (below the luxury zones)
- Sterile: white walls, LED panels, medical-grade cleanliness
- Equipment: neural monitoring stations, experimental interfaces, data servers
- Security: reinforced doors, biometric locks, surveillance cameras
- Atmosphere: clinical, secretive, institutional

**Reginald's Appearance**:
- Same age, but different demeanor entirely
- Wearing: casual researcher clothes (button-down, slacks, lab coat)
- Face: intense, focused, worried (not relaxed)
- Eyes: sharp, alert, fearful
- Posture: hunched over data terminal, working frantically

**The Encounter**:
- Alexa arrives (doesn't remember how she got the address)
- Reginald expects her: "You're the operative. They said you'd come."
- He's discovered something in temporal research: "They're not just editing memories. They're creating loops. Causal loops. Predetermined outcomes."
- Shows her data: experimental logs showing test subjects caught in recursive time patterns
- He knows too much: "I tried to stop the project. They can't let me live."
- Alexa feels her neural interface activate WITHOUT her consent
- Voice in her head (not her thoughts): "EXTRACT. УСТРАНИТЬ." (EXTRACT. ELIMINATE.)
- Her body moves independently: drawing weapon, neural override
- She SHOOTS Reginald (combat neural programming)
- Downloads his research data while he bleeds out
- Plants evidence of natural causes
- Leaves

**Key Details in True Version**:
- Laboratory setting (not penthouse)
- Reginald as researcher/whistleblower (not hedonist)
- Discovery about causal loops
- Neural override - Alexa didn't choose to kill him
- She was weaponized without consent
- Downloaded research data (where is it now?)

**THE CAT DETAIL**:
During the encounter, while Reginald was showing her the research data, a **silver-grey cat with green eyes** was present in the laboratory. The cat:
- Sat on the desk near the terminal
- Watched the interaction calmly
- Reginald mentioned it: "Schrödinger understands. Quantum superposition. The cat knows more than we do."
- The cat didn't react to the violence (strange - as if accustomed)
- Last thing Alexa saw before leaving: the cat sitting next to Reginald's body, green eyes reflecting her departing figure

**Emotional Tone of True Memory**:
- Horror at being controlled
- Rage at violation of her autonomy
- Guilt at killing (even under control)
- Fear of what she is/what she's been made into
- Confusion about the cat's presence

**Reveals**:
- Alexa is a corporate weapon (neural override capability)
- Reginald discovered something about causal loops
- The murder was premeditated by the corporation
- Alexa's autonomy is an illusion
- The cat is somehow significant (Reginald's comment suggests importance)

**Dialogue/Action Ratio**: 50% dialogue (remembered), 50% action/description

**Key Dialogue (True Version)**:
- Reginald: "You're the operative. They said you'd come."
- Reginald: "They're creating loops. Cause and effect locked in recursion. Do you understand? We're not experiencing time—we're trapped in their pattern."
- Reginald: "Schrödinger understands. Quantum superposition. The cat knows more than we do."
- Reginald: (as Alexa's weapon rises) "You don't want to do this. I can see it in your eyes. You're not in control—"
- Voice in Alexa's head: "EXTRACT. УСТРАНИТЬ."

**Ends With**: Alexa fully experiencing the recovered memory, focusing on the cat detail

---

### Beat 7: The Cat Realization (Est. 150-200 words)
**Type**: Disaster/Discovery
**Purpose**: Isolate the critical detail, create new mystery

**Action**:
Alexa exits the memory dive, returns to her apartment. Sits in darkness, processing. Her mind keeps returning to one detail: the cat. Silver-grey with green eyes. Named Schrödinger.

**Analysis**:
She compares the two versions systematically:
- **False version**: No cat. No animals at all.
- **True version**: Cat present, Reginald commented on it specifically, linked it to his research.

**Questions**:
- Why remove the cat from the false memory?
- What does "Schrödinger" mean? (She knows the famous thought experiment: cat in superposition, alive and dead)
- Why did Reginald say "the cat knows more than we do"?
- Why didn't the cat react to violence?
- Where is the cat now?

**Realization**:
The cat isn't just a pet. It's connected to Reginald's research. They removed it from her memory deliberately. Which means the cat is important. Dangerous to remember.

**Decision**:
She needs to find out what happened to Reginald's cat. It's a thread. Pull it, see what unravels.

**Reveals**:
- The cat is the next investigative target
- Alexa is committed to uncovering the truth
- She's thinking like a detective now (emotional shock transforming into purpose)
- New mystery layer introduced

**Dialogue/Action Ratio**: 30% internal dialogue, 70% description/action

**Internal Monologue**:
- *The cat. They erased the cat.*
- *Why? A detail so small. Unless it's not small.*
- *Schrödinger. Superposition. Alive and dead until observed.*
- *What did Reginald mean? What does the cat know?*
- *Find the cat. Find the answer.*

**Mood/Tone**: Detective focus crystallizing, cold determination replacing shock

**Ends With**: Hook for Scene 0208 - Alexa beginning to deduce the cat's significance, forming plan to investigate

## TECHNICAL DETAILS: HOME "MIRROR" SYSTEM

### Device Description
- **Form**: Compact neural interface headset
- **Size**: Sleeker than corporate version, fits in drawer
- **Connection**: Temple sensors (four points of contact)
- **Power**: Personal battery, 4-hour capacity
- **Display**: Projects directly into visual cortex (no external screen)

### Capabilities
- Memory playback (personal memories only)
- Limited editing (flag/tag memories, not alter)
- Basic analysis (detect seams, inconsistencies)
- Solo operation (dangerous - no safety operator)

### Limitations
- **No deep editing**: Can't create or remove memories like corporate system
- **No extraction**: Can't transfer memories to external storage
- **Monitoring risk**: Corporate could detect usage if they're watching her network
- **Safety**: No emergency disconnect if she gets stuck in a memory

### Risks of Solo Use
- **Dissociation**: Getting lost in memory playback
- **Neural feedback**: If she encounters corrupted/edited memory, could cause pain
- **Psychological**: Confronting traumatic memories without support
- **Physical**: If interface malfunctions, could cause seizure

### Why Alexa Has It
- **Professional tool**: Many memory technicians have home units (technically allowed)
- **Practice**: Used for training, personal memory maintenance
- **Convenience**: Can review case files privately (grey area ethically)
- **Control**: Alexa likes having tools at her disposal

---

## VISUALIZATION: MEMORY SPACE

### General Appearance
**Environment**:
- Vast darkness (like deep space)
- No horizon, no ground, no sky
- Infinite in all directions
- Silence (absolute)

**Memories as Objects**:
- Appear as luminous clusters
- Glow intensity = recency/emotional charge
- Size = complexity/duration
- Color = emotional valence
  - Warm (red/gold) = positive emotions
  - Cool (blue/silver) = neutral/professional
  - Dark (purple/black) = negative emotions

**Spatial Organization**:
- Chronological: older memories "deeper" in space
- Thematic: related memories cluster together
- Associative: memories with shared elements link via subtle threads of light

### Navigation
- **Movement**: Think of a memory, you move toward it
- **Speed**: Variable (can rush or drift)
- **Sensation**: Floating, no proprioception
- **Focus**: Like adjusting eyes in darkness, memories sharpen when attended to

### Edited Memories Appearance
- **Too bright**: Artificial enhancement
- **Sharp edges**: Natural memories have soft, blurred boundaries
- **Perfect detail**: Real memories fade, blur, have gaps
- **Color saturation**: Overly vivid, like HDR photography
- **Seams**: Visible discontinuities where false memory connects to real timeline

### Experiencing a Memory
- **Activation**: Move close, "touch" the memory cluster
- **Immersion**: Suddenly inside the memory, experiencing it first-person
- **Awareness split**: Part of you experiences, part observes (dissociative)
- **Exit**: Pull back, memory fades, return to memory space

## COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: FALSE VS. TRUE VERSION

### Side-by-Side Comparison

| Aspect | False Version | True Version |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **Location** | Penthouse suite, Floor 298 | Laboratory, Floor 163 |
| **Setting** | Opulent, luxurious | Clinical, sterile |
| **Reginald's Role** | Hedonistic collector | Research whistleblower |
| **Reginald's State** | High, relaxed, dying of overdose | Alert, fearful, shot by Alexa |
| **Alexa's Role** | Professional extraction tech | Unwitting corporate assassin |
| **Memory Collection** | Crystals with archived pleasures | Data servers with research logs |
| **Atmosphere** | Decadent, tragic | Terrifying, conspiratorial |
| **Death Cause** | Overdose (accident) | Murder (corporate elimination) |
| **Alexa's Agency** | Full (tried to help) | None (neural override) |
| **Emotional Response** | Pity, frustration | Horror, guilt, rage |
| **Key Props** | Wine, velvet furniture, memory crystals | Lab equipment, data terminal, weapon |
| **THE CAT** | **ABSENT** | **PRESENT (silver-grey, green eyes)** |
| **Cat's Name** | N/A | Schrödinger |
| **Reginald's Comment** | N/A | "The cat knows more than we do" |
| **Discovery** | None | Causal loops research |
| **Evidence** | Natural death (staged) | Downloaded research data |

### Why the Cat Matters
- **Only detail that's completely removed**: Everything else was reframed, but the cat is entirely absent
- **Deliberate erasure**: Not just changed, but eliminated
- **Reginald's emphasis**: He specifically mentioned the cat, linked it to his research
- **Symbolic**: Schrödinger's cat = quantum superposition = temporal manipulation
- **Unexplained behavior**: Cat didn't react to violence (as if it knew, or had seen before)
- **Still alive**: If Alexa can find the cat, it might lead to answers

---

## CHARACTER VOICE: ALEXA'S INTERNAL MONOLOGUE

### Tone Characteristics
- **Clinical precision**: She thinks in technical terms
- **Self-distancing**: Refers to herself as "the subject" when analyzing
- **Dark humor**: Coping mechanism (Gillian Flynn influence)
- **Fragmented under stress**: Complete sentences break down when fear intrudes
- **Professional jargon**: Uses memory tech terminology naturally

### Example Internal Thoughts

**During dive**:
> *Neural handshake established. Connection stable. Treat yourself as Subject A. Distance. Observe. Don't feel.*

**Examining childhood**:
> *Orphanage memory: sensory details consistent, emotional valence genuine, temporal sequencing intact. Edges natural—soft, blurred, the way real memory degrades. No seams. They didn't touch this. Why? Efficiency? Or did they only edit what threatened them?*

**Comparing versions**:
> *False version: penthouse. True version: laboratory. False: collector. True: whistleblower. False: overdose. True: murder. False: I tried to help. True: I was the weapon.*

**The cat realization**:
> *Silver-grey fur. Green eyes. Schrödinger. Present in the true version. Completely absent from the false. Not reframed. Not altered. Removed. Why erase a cat unless the cat matters? Unless remembering the cat is dangerous?*

**Building determination**:
> *Find the cat. The thread they cut. Pull it. Watch everything unravel.*

## DIALOGUE NOTES

### Internal Dialogue Only
This scene is mostly internal—Alexa alone with her thoughts and memories. Dialogue appears only:
1. **In memories**: Conversations with Reginald (both versions)
2. **With herself**: Brief, sharp thoughts aloud when breaking down or crystallizing decisions

### False Memory Dialogue Style
- **Reginald**: Languid, philosophical, hedonistic
- **Tone**: Casual, relaxed, self-indulgent
- **Content**: Collecting experiences, pleasure, transgression

**Examples**:
- "Each memory in my collection is a masterpiece."
- "Do you ever keep copies? The temptation must be exquisite."
- "Protocol. Such a beautiful word for a cage."

### True Memory Dialogue Style
- **Reginald**: Urgent, technical, fearful
- **Tone**: Rushed, desperate, knowing
- **Content**: Conspiracy, temporal loops, research, doom

**Examples**:
- "You're the operative. They said you'd come."
- "They're creating loops. Cause and effect locked in recursion."
- "Schrödinger understands. Quantum superposition. The cat knows more than we do."
- "You don't want to do this. I can see it in your eyes. You're not in control—"

### Neural Override Voice
- **Not Alexa's voice**: Foreign, cold, command-like
- **Language**: Mix of English and Russian (corporate security protocol)
- **Tone**: Emotionless, absolute

**Example**:
- "EXTRACT. УСТРАНИТЬ." (EXTRACT. ELIMINATE.)

## WORLD-BUILDING INTEGRATION

### Elements to Showcase

**Memory Technology**:
- Personal neural interfaces (home use common among professionals)
- Memory space visualization (how memories are experienced subjectively)
- Edited memories have detectable signatures (if you know to look)
- Solo diving is possible but dangerous

**Corporate Control**:
- Neural override capability exists (weaponizing operatives)
- Employees can be activated without consent
- Memory editing used for operational security
- Surveillance extends to personal devices (potential monitoring)

**Temporal Research** (via Reginald's dialogue):
- Causal loops are real (not just theoretical)
- Experiments conducted on subjects
- Research dangerous enough to require whistleblower elimination
- Connection to quantum mechanics (Schrödinger reference)

**Social Details**:
- Floor numbers indicate status (163 sublevel vs. 298 penthouse)
- Laboratories hidden below luxury zones
- Wealthy collect archived memories (black market)
- Animals rare/significant in vertical city

### Integration Method
- **Natural through action**: Alexa uses tech, we see how it works
- **Through memory content**: World details in the remembered scenes
- **Via comparison**: False vs. true reveals what's valuable/dangerous
- **Character knowledge**: Alexa's technical understanding shows naturally

---

## FORESHADOWING

### Planted Elements

**The Cat (Primary)**:
- Silver-grey with green eyes
- Named Schrödinger (quantum reference)
- Present during conspiracy revelation
- Didn't react to violence (unnaturally calm)
- Reginald's comment: "knows more than we do"
- **Payoff**: Scene 0208+ investigation into cat's significance

**Downloaded Research Data**:
- Alexa downloaded Reginald's research during the murder
- She doesn't remember what happened to it
- **Payoff**: Data still exists somewhere (neural implant? hidden storage?)

**Neural Override Capability**:
- Alexa was controlled remotely
- Voice in her head, body moving independently
- **Payoff**: Can she be controlled again? By whom? How to prevent it?

**Causal Loops Research**:
- Reginald discovered something about predetermined outcomes
- "We're trapped in their pattern"
- **Payoff**: Later revelations about temporal manipulation scale

**Corporate Elimination Protocol**:
- Reginald knew someone would come
- "They said you'd come"
- **Payoff**: Alexa realizes she's one of multiple corporate assets

### Subtle Details

**The Laboratory Location**:
- Floor 163 (sublevel, hidden)
- **Implication**: More hidden facilities exist

**Reginald's Fear**:
- He knew he was doomed but stayed to transfer data
- **Implication**: What he discovered was worth dying for

**Memory Editing Precision**:
- Only Reginald memory altered, childhood left intact
- **Implication**: They edit strategically, conserve resources

**Alexa's Skill Set**:
- Can operate home neural interface solo
- Knows how to detect memory editing
- **Implication**: She's more capable than typical operative

## HOOKS AND TRANSITIONS

### Opening Hook (from Scene 0206)
**Previous scene ended with**: Alexa in her apartment, decision made to check what else was altered

**This scene opens with**: Immediate action—bypassing routines, going straight to equipment. No delay. Show her professionalism taking over from shock.

**Opening line suggestion**:
> "Treat yourself as a client. Standard memory audit. Professional distance."

### Internal Scene Hooks

**Beat 1 → Beat 2**: Interface activated → diving into memory space
**Beat 2 → Beat 3**: Navigating toward childhood → checking earliest memories
**Beat 3 → Beat 4**: Relief (childhood intact) → checking professional memories
**Beat 4 → Beat 5**: Pattern recognized → time to compare versions directly
**Beat 5 → Beat 6**: False version examined → shifting to true version
**Beat 6 → Beat 7**: True version experienced → fixating on the cat detail

### Closing Hook (to Scene 0208)

**This scene ends with**: Alexa crystallizing her focus on the cat. Detective mode activated. She needs to find out what happened to Schrödinger.

**Final lines suggestion**:
> "Silver-grey fur. Green eyes. Schrödinger.
>
> They erased a cat from her memory.

## WRITING STYLE NOTES

### Sentence Structure
**Use complex sentences with deeps and participles** (per user instruction):
- *"Activating the interface with trembling hands she barely recognized as her own, Alexa felt the neural connection establish itself, a cold tingle spreading from temple sensors into her consciousness, splitting her awareness into observer and observed."*
- *"The memory unfolded before her—false and perfect—showing Reginald lounging on red velvet, offering wine with a hedonist's smile, while somewhere beneath the constructed surface her real memory screamed its truth."*

### Pacing Through Prose
- **Longer sentences**: For memory immersion, technical description, building tension
- **Shorter sentences**: For sharp realizations, emotional hits, action
- **Fragments**: For extreme stress or revelation moments

### Tone Consistency
- **Clinical detachment**: Alexa's coping mechanism
- **Underlying horror**: Breaking through in moments
- **Detective focus**: Building through scene
- **Dark wit**: Occasional, brief (Gillian Flynn style)

**Example tone**:
> *Professional distance: the tool that had served her for eight years. Treat the subject objectively. Note discrepancies. Document findings. Ignore the fact that the subject was herself, that the discrepancies were violations, that the findings were horror.*

### Show, Don't Tell
**Bad**: She was terrified.
**Good**: Her hands shook as she calibrated the sensors, a tremor she couldn't suppress with professional training.

**Bad**: The memory was fake.
**Good**: The edges were too sharp, colors too saturated—like a photograph enhanced past reality.

**Bad**: She needed to find the cat.
**Good**: The thread they'd cut. Pull it, watch everything unravel. Starting with a silver-grey cat named after a quantum paradox.

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Must Include
1. **Technical process**: Show how home neural interface works
2. **Memory space visualization**: Establish how memories appear subjectively
3. **Childhood check**: Establish some memories are intact (relief moment)
4. **Professional memories check**: Build pattern of what's edited vs. intact
5. **Detailed false memory**: Full penthouse scene with Reginald as hedonist
6. **Detailed true memory**: Full laboratory scene with Reginald as whistleblower
7. **The cat detail**: Silver-grey, green eyes, name Schrödinger, Reginald's comment
8. **Comparison analysis**: Alexa explicitly noting differences
9. **Detective focus**: Transition from shock to analytical investigation
10. **Hook ending**: Cat becomes the next investigative target

### Must Avoid
1. **Exposition dumps**: Integrate world-building naturally
2. **Over-explaining**: Trust reader to follow memory space concept
3. **Emotional melodrama**: Keep Alexa's voice clinical even under stress
4. **Rushed comparison**: Give adequate space to both memory versions
5. **Unclear tech**: Make neural interface comprehensible but not over-detailed
6. **Forgetting the cat**: This is the key discovery—emphasize it

### Must Setup for Future Scenes
1. **Cat investigation** (Scene 0208): Alexa's next goal
2. **Neural override concern**: She can be controlled again
3. **Research data**: Still exists somewhere
4. **Causal loops**: Major plot element introduced
5. **Corporate threat**: They're watching her
